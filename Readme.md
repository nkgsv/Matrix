# Overview
A javascript based tool for learning elementary operations with rows and columns of matrices. You can [try it here][1].

# Usage
Drag and drop the elements of the matrix to perform elementary operations with rows or columns. Examples:

* Drag the first element of the first row and drop it to the first element of the second row. The first row will be added to the second one. (&alpha;=+1)
* Drag the second element of the third column to the second element of the first column. The third column will be added to the first one. (&alpha;=+1)
* Hold ALT to subtract instead of adding. (&alpha;=-1)
* Hold SHIFT to compute the multiplier &alpha; in such a way that the target element becomes zero.
* Hold CTRL to move the selected row or column.
* Enter a number on the right of a row and hit ENTER to multipy the row by this number. E.g. enter "1/2" to divide by 2.
* Similar for columns.
* Click "Edit matrix" and change the values of the elements. Then click "Lock matrix".
* Do not use Internet Explorer. Use Chrome or Firefox.
